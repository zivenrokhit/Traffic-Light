# Traffic-Light
This project will teach you how to make an automated traffic light system using an ultrasonic sensor, 3 leds, and an lcd(16x2). The ultrasonic sensor is used to calculate the distance of an object which is then displayed on the lcd screen. Once the object comes within 10cm of the of the system a the traffic lights follow a specific pattern to direct "traffic".
